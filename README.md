Welcome to the Dimmest Dungeon, Adventurer!

    W – Scrolls cursor up.
    S – Scroll cursor down.
    D – Selection at where your cursor is.
-	Your cursor will be this:   -->
-	The character whose turn it is has an indication in their party menu: >

Gameplay Tips
-	Your text log in the middle of the screen will key you in on what is happening throughout the game, so pay close attention to it, everything that occurs will update there! Whenever a correct or incorrect action is made, the text log will let you know the consequences of the action.
-	Be warned, the further you journey into the dungeon, the more challenging the monsters you will encounter. This will also mean the better your chances of getting great loot! There is an end to the game, of course.
-	Loot will take form in either coins (monetary), potions/elixirs (rejuvenation of your adventurers), or magical items which offer a unique stat boost on whomever they are equipped to.

Player Stats
	(HP) Health Points are the life of your adventurer, if it reaches 0, they die.
    (MP) Mana points are the points you can expend to use abilities, if this reaches 0, the character can only use basic attacks.
    (ATK) Attack determines how much offensive damage a certain character can do with basic attacks or skills/spells.
    (DEF) Defense determines how much damage can be blocked from enemy attacks.

Dungeon Options:
 You start off in a dungeon and will start your journey! 
-	The depth determines what floor you are on in the dungeon, the higher the depth, the harder the monsters and more rewarding the loot.
-	Your coins denote the amount of money you have amassed throughout the game.
-	A ASCII art display will showcase unique doors with unique instances behind them. Choose any door with the WSD keys and see what lies within. Will it be treasure? Monsters? Neither? 
-	View Party: You can see what party members you have here. They have a name, job class, current health points (HP) out of maximum health points (HP), current mana points (MP) out of maximum mana points (MP). Beneath these are skills, their names, their effects, and their mana cost (MP).


Combat Options:
-	When you use the stun mechanic, it will give a chance for the monster to lose their next turn, this is denoted by an “@” sign next to their name.
-	Each player and monster will have a turn. On your adventurers’ turns, pick from using a basic attack, your skills, or a potion/elixir.
